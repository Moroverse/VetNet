## Progress

### Update - 2025-08-06 17:40 GMT

**Summary**: Successfully implemented UI testing infrastructure foundation with working screen object pattern

**Git Changes**:
- Added: App/UITests/VetNetUITestCase.swift (async setUp/tearDown base class)
- Added: App/UITests/PatientCreationTests.swift (first happy path test)
- Added: App/UITests/VetNetScreen.swift (screen object pattern implementation)
- Added: docs/ui-testing-todo.md (comprehensive 6-phase development plan)
- Modified: Project.swift (VetNetUITests target configuration)
- Current branch: s1 (commit: f2b437d)

**Todo Progress**: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Create comprehensive UI testing todo list document on disk
- ‚úì Completed: Set up UI Test target in Project.swift
- ‚úì Completed: Create VetNetUITestCase base class with app launch/reset
- ‚úì Completed: Create VetNetScreen base class with element finding
- ‚úì Completed: Implement first test: Complete patient creation happy path

**Key Achievements**:
- Resolved Swift 6 concurrency issues with async setUp/tearDown and MainActor.run pattern
- Implemented test-driven development approach - let compiler errors guide API design
- Created fluent screen object pattern with method chaining for readable tests
- Successfully verified app navigation: launch ‚Üí patient list ‚Üí tap "Add" button
- All UI tests passing (7.65 seconds execution time)

**Technical Discoveries**:
- XCUIApplication requires MainActor isolation in Swift 6
- App launches directly to PatientManagementView (no navigation needed)
- Screen object methods need @MainActor annotation for XCUIApplication interaction
- Navigation-based testing approach chosen over direct screen creation for integration value

**Issues Encountered & Solutions**:
1. **Swift 6 Concurrency Errors**: "Call to main actor-isolated initializer 'init()'"
   - Solution: Use async setUp/tearDown with MainActor.run pattern
2. **Screen Object Concurrency**: Methods accessing XCUIApplication properties failed
   - Solution: Add @MainActor to screen object methods
3. **Test Method Isolation**: Test methods needed proper actor context
   - Solution: Mark test methods with @MainActor

**Next Steps**:
- Implement form field interactions (enterPatientName, selectSpecies, etc.)
- Add proper element finding with accessibility identifiers
- Continue following Phase 2 of ui-testing-todo.md for form validation tests

### Update - 2025-08-06 20:33 GMT

**Summary**: Made progress on form field interactions, encountered critical idle state issue with species picker

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: App/UITests/VetNetScreen.swift (added enterPatientName, selectSpecies implementations)
- Modified: App/UITests/VetNetUITestCase.swift (added animation disabling launch arguments)
- Added: App/UITests/SpeciesSelectionTest.swift (isolated test for debugging)
- Current branch: s1 (commit: f2b437d)

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 1 in progress, 3 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Implement enterPatientName with text field interaction
- üîÑ In Progress: Implement selectSpecies with picker interaction (blocked)

**Critical Issue Encountered**:
**XCUITest Idle State Timeout**: Species picker interaction causes tests to hang indefinitely waiting for app to reach idle state. Multiple approaches attempted:

1. **Text Field Focus Theory**: Initially suspected active text field was preventing idle state
   - Added keyboard dismiss logic before species selection
   - Created isolated test without text field interaction
   - Issue persisted, ruling out text field as cause

2. **Animation Interference Theory**: Suspected UI animations preventing idle state
   - Added launch arguments: `-UIViewAnimationsDisabled`, `-UITableViewRowAnimationsDisabled`, `-UICollectionViewAnimationsDisabled`
   - Added environment variables: `UITEST_DISABLE_ANIMATIONS=1`, `ANIMATIONS_DISABLED=1`
   - Issue persisted, animations not the root cause

3. **Picker Element Interaction Issue**: Core problem appears to be:
   - Species picker found successfully (`patient_creation_species_picker` identifier works)
   - Picker tap executes successfully
   - "Dog" StaticText found and tap attempted
   - Error: "Targeted element StaticText is no longer valid after interruption handling"
   - App never returns to idle state after picker interaction

**Technical Details Discovered**:
- `enterPatientName()` works perfectly (text field interaction successful)
- `selectSpecies()` finds picker element and "Dog" option correctly
- Issue occurs specifically during picker option tap causing UI state disruption
- QuickForm FormPickerField behavior may auto-dismiss on focus loss

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Retry logic for stale element references
2. Coordinate-based tapping instead of direct element tap
3. Wait strategies and timeout adjustments
4. Animation disabling at app level
5. Isolated testing to eliminate interaction dependencies

**Current Status**: Blocked on species picker interaction - needs investigation into:
- QuickForm FormPickerField implementation details
- Alternative element selection strategies (wheel vs menu pickers)
- XCUITest idle state configuration options
- Possibility of using accessibility actions instead of tap gestures

### Update - 2025-08-07 06:50 GMT

**Summary**: Deep investigation into XCUITest idle state timeout issue with comprehensive debugging

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: App/UITests/VetNetScreen.swift (commented out problematic picker code)
- Current branch: s1 (commit: 59a5627)

**Todo Progress**: 0 completed, 1 in progress, 2 pending
- üîÑ In Progress: Fix XCUITest idle state issue with species picker
- ‚è≥ Pending: Implement complete patient creation test flow
- ‚è≥ Pending: Add remaining form field interactions

**Critical Discovery**: The issue is NOT in QuickForm itself! User's isolated QuickForm test works perfectly, confirming the problem lies in VetNet's environment.

**Debugging Process**:
1. **Systematic Code Elimination**: Commented out all suspected background activities:
   - NotificationCenter observers (FeatureFlagDidChangeMessage)
   - Shake gesture publishers
   - Development configuration Tasks
   - SwiftUIRouting animations
   - All app initialization logic

2. **QuickForm Source Analysis**: Examined QuickForm source code at `/Volumes/Ex_Machina/Developer/Moroverse/quick-form/`:
   - FormPickerField is clean SwiftUI Picker implementation
   - PickerFieldViewModel uses simple Dispatcher (synchronous event system)
   - Found Combine-based Inspection system in DEBUG builds with `PassthroughSubject`
   - Potential culprit: `.onReceive(inspection.notice)` creating continuous publishers

3. **Environment Testing**: User confirmed isolated QuickForm project works fine, definitively proving issue is VetNet-specific

**Attempted Solutions**:
- ‚ùå Commented out NotificationCenter publishers
- ‚ùå Disabled async Tasks in app initialization  
- ‚ùå Removed SwiftUIRouting animations
- ‚ùå Added UI test detection with early return
- ‚ùå All approaches still resulted in indefinite hang

**Current Understanding**: The idle state issue occurs when app never reaches idle after picker interaction. Possible remaining causes:
- Sheet presentation lifecycle interactions
- SwiftUIRouting form router Task creation (line 114 in BaseFormRouter)
- CloudKit background sync operations
- Interaction between NavigationStack + Sheet + Form lifecycle

**Next Steps Identified**:
1. Implement waitForQuiescence swizzling as workaround
2. Try coordinate-based picker tapping instead of element tap
3. Add debug logging to pinpoint exact failure moment
4. Consider minimal reproduction test (sheet presentation only)

**Session Outcome**: Reset to clean slate after comprehensive investigation. Need to implement practical workaround to continue UI test development while maintaining clean production code.

### Update - 2025-08-07 17:24 GMT

**Summary**: Confirmed QuickForm is not the issue - Belfalas demo project works perfectly

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: App/UITests/VetNetScreen.swift (changed species selector from staticTexts to buttons.firstMatch)
- Added: App/UITests/SimplePatientTest.swift (isolated tests for debugging)
- Added: Belfalas/ directory with minimal QuickForm demo project
- Modified: App/UITests/PatientCreationTests.swift (disabled problematic test)
- Current branch: s1

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ **Belfalas project proves QuickForm works fine** - Simple app with just QuickForm in a Form runs UI tests perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Name field interaction works** - testOnlyPatientName passes in 14.5 seconds
- ‚ùå **Species picker still causes timeout** - Even with button selector fix from Belfalas

**Critical Discovery**: The issue is NOT QuickForm itself but VetNet's complex environment:
- Belfalas: Minimal app (ContentView ‚Üí Form ‚Üí QuickForm fields) - WORKS
- VetNet: Complex app (NavigationStack ‚Üí Sheet ‚Üí Form ‚Üí QuickForm fields + SwiftUIRouting + CloudKit + FactoryKit) - FAILS

**Test Results**:
- SimplePatientTest/testOnlyPatientName: ‚úÖ PASS (14.503 seconds)
- SimplePatientTest/testSpeciesPickerOnly: ‚ùå TIMEOUT
- Belfalas AnimalEditTests: ‚úÖ PASS (all tests)

**Selector Strategy Evolution**:
1. Original VetNet: `app.staticTexts[species]` - timeout
2. Belfalas working: `app.buttons[species].firstMatch` - works in Belfalas
3. Applied to VetNet: `app.buttons[species].firstMatch` - still timeout in VetNet

**Remaining Suspects**:
- Sheet presentation lifecycle in SwiftUIRouting
- NavigationStack + Sheet + Form interaction
- Background Tasks from SwiftUIRouting BaseFormRouter
- App initialization complexity

**Next Steps**:
- Consider XCUITest workarounds (disable waitForQuiescence)
- Investigate sheet presentation without SwiftUIRouting
- Create minimal reproduction with just NavigationStack + Sheet

### Update - 2025-08-07 17:45 GMT

**Summary**: Definitively proved SwiftUIRouting is NOT the cause of XCUITest timeout

**Git Changes**:
- Added: Belfalas/ directory with complete SwiftUIRouting demo
- Modified: Belfalas/Belfalas/Sources/ContentView.swift (implemented full SwiftUIRouting pattern)
- Modified: Belfalas/Project.swift (added SwiftUIRouting dependency)
- Added: Belfalas/Belfalas/Sources/ContentView.swift (AnimalFormResult with RouteResult conformance)
- Modified: App/UITests/VetNetScreen.swift (species picker selector fix)
- Added: App/UITests/SimplePatientTest.swift (isolated debugging tests)
- Current branch: s1

**Todo Progress**: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Add SwiftUIRouting package dependency to Belfalas
- ‚úì Completed: Implement basic routing for sheet presentation
- ‚úì Completed: Run tests to see if SwiftUIRouting causes timeout
- ‚úì Completed: Fix SwiftUIRouting implementation to match VetNet's pattern
- ‚úì Completed: Analyze results and identify next steps

**Critical Breakthrough**: Belfalas with full SwiftUIRouting implementation PASSES all UI tests (15.3 seconds)

**Test Results**:
- Belfalas + SwiftUIRouting + FormRouterView + BaseFormRouter: ‚úÖ PASS
- VetNet SimplePatientTest (name field only): ‚úÖ PASS (14.5 seconds)  
- VetNet species picker test: ‚ùå TIMEOUT

**Components Definitively Eliminated as Root Cause**:
- ‚ùå QuickForm (proven with basic Belfalas)
- ‚ùå Sheet presentation (proven with sheet Belfalas) 
- ‚ùå SwiftUIRouting (proven with full routing Belfalas)
- ‚ùå NavigationStack + Sheet + Form combo
- ‚ùå FormRouterView + BaseFormRouter async patterns

**Root Cause Narrowed Down**: Issue is VetNet-specific background services preventing XCUITest idle state after picker interaction. Remaining suspects:
1. FactoryKit heavy dependency injection graph
2. StateKit complex state management  
3. CloudKit continuous background sync
4. Feature flag NotificationCenter publishers
5. Development configuration background Tasks

**Next Investigation Steps**:
- Profile VetNet app during picker interaction to identify active background tasks
- Implement XCUITest waitForQuiescence workarounds
- Add UI test environment detection to disable background services
- Consider minimal VetNet reproduction without service layer

### Update - 2025-08-07 17:52 GMT

**Summary**: Proved FactoryKit is NOT the cause + discovered StateKit is not actually used in app

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: Belfalas/Project.swift (added FactoryKit dependency)
- Modified: Belfalas/Belfalas/Sources/ContentView.swift (added AnimalRepository, MockRepository, Container extension, @Injected usage)
- Current branch: s1

**Todo Progress**: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Add FactoryKit dependency to Belfalas
- ‚úì Completed: Create AnimalRepository protocol and implementation
- ‚úì Completed: Set up Container with animalRepository factory
- ‚úì Completed: Update AnimalFormView to use @Injected(\.animalRepository)
- ‚úì Completed: Run tests to see if FactoryKit causes timeout

**Major Breakthrough**: Belfalas with full FactoryKit dependency injection PASSES all UI tests (15.3 seconds)

**Test Results**:
- Belfalas + SwiftUIRouting + FactoryKit + @Injected + async repository: ‚úÖ PASS
- Includes: Container factory, repository with Task.sleep delays, async operations, result handling
- VetNet species picker: ‚ùå Still times out

**Critical Discovery**: StateKit is NOT actually being used in VetNet app! Only imported but no active functionality.

**Components Definitively Eliminated as Root Cause**:
- ‚ùå QuickForm 
- ‚ùå Sheet presentation
- ‚ùå SwiftUIRouting + FormRouterView + BaseFormRouter
- ‚ùå FactoryKit dependency injection + @Injected
- ‚ùå StateKit (not even used in app)
- ‚ùå Async repository operations

**Significantly Narrowed Root Cause**: Issue must be one of VetNet's **actual running background services**:
1. **CloudKit** - Background sync operations and ModelContainer setup
2. **Feature flag notifications** - NotificationCenter publishers
3. **Development configuration** - Background Tasks  
4. **Shake gesture detection** - Continuous gesture publishers
5. **App initialization complexity** - Multiple service initialization

**Next Investigation Priority**: Profile VetNet during picker interaction to identify which active background service prevents XCUITest idle state

### Update - 2025-08-08 05:19 GMT

**Summary**: üéâ BREAKTHROUGH! Identified and fixed the root cause of XCUITest species picker timeout issue

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: PatientFormView.swift (implemented onAppear lazy initialization pattern)
- Modified: Container+VetNet.swift (added UI test mode detection, fixed mock repository bug)
- Modified: DevelopmentConfigurationService.swift (added UI test mode bypass)
- Modified: VetNetApp.swift (added UI test mode detection)
- Modified: VetNetUITestCase.swift (added UI_TEST_MODE launch argument)
- Added: SimplePatientTest.swift (isolated debugging tests)
- Current branch: s1 (commit: 0cad85b)

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Implement onAppear lazy initialization in PatientFormView
- ‚úì Completed: Revert formState = .editing debugging changes in PatientFormViewModel  
- ‚úì Completed: Revert species onValueChanged handler debugging changes
- ‚úì Completed: Test species picker with fixed initialization

**Root Cause Discovered**: 
PatientFormView was being **recreated** when picker popover opened, causing new PatientFormViewModel instance creation in init, which triggered configure() method and breed.allValues updates, preventing XCUITest from reaching idle state.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **onAppear Lazy Initialization Pattern** following 2024 SwiftUI best practices
- `@State private var viewModel: PatientFormViewModel?` (made optional)
- Removed view model creation from init
- Added onAppear with guard: `if viewModel == nil { // create once }`
- Guard ensures init-only-once regardless of onAppear call frequency

**Key Discoveries**:
1. **@State initialization in init() is problematic** - SwiftUI recreates views unpredictably
2. **View recreation during popover presentation** - common SwiftUI behavior that breaks naive initialization
3. **Systematic elimination process effective** - proved QuickForm, SwiftUIRouting, FactoryKit were not issues using Belfalas demo
4. **UI test detection patterns** - added UI_TEST_MODE launch argument for environment-specific behavior

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Species picker test: PASS (12.4 seconds, previously timed out)
- ‚úÖ Name field test: PASS (12.3 seconds, still working)
- ‚úÖ All form functionality preserved with proper @Observable behavior

**Technical Learnings**:
- **SwiftUI @State lifecycle quirks**: External data in init() only works first time due to caching
- **View identity vs view instances**: SwiftUI can recreate view instances while maintaining identity
- **Modal/popover presentation effects**: Can trigger parent view recreation in complex hierarchies  
- **XCUITest idle state sensitivity**: Background state changes prevent test completion even if UI appears stable

**Architecture Improvements Made**:
- Fixed Container bug where mock data flag incorrectly returned SwiftData repository
- Enhanced UI test environment with proper service bypasses
- Demonstrated systematic debugging approach for complex integration issues

**Future Prevention**:
- Use onAppear lazy initialization for @State view models with external dependencies
- Consider @StateObject for ObservableObject models (has proper lifecycle management)
- Always test picker interactions in UI tests as they're particularly sensitive
- Implement UI test mode detection early in complex apps

- **Problem**: Creating view models in SwiftUI init() causes recreation issues
- **Solution**: Move to onAppear with nil-check guard for one-time initialization

#### 4. **Container Mock Repository Bug**
- **Problem**: Mock data flag incorrectly returned SwiftData repository
- **Solution**: Fixed conditional logic to return MockPatientRepository when enabled

### üîß Technical Discoveries

#### SwiftUI Lifecycle Quirks
- **View Recreation**: SwiftUI recreates view instances during modal/popover presentation
- **@State Caching**: External data in init() only works first time due to identity caching
- **View Identity vs Instances**: SwiftUI can recreate instances while maintaining view identity

#### XCUITest Sensitivity
- **Idle State Detection**: Background state changes prevent test completion even if UI appears stable
- **Picker Interactions**: Particularly sensitive to view recreation and state cascades
- **Modal Presentation**: Complex UI hierarchies require careful state management

#### Architecture Patterns (2024)
- **@State vs @StateObject**: @State with @Observable requires careful lifecycle management
- **onAppear Pattern**: Recommended for view models with external dependencies
- **Guard Pattern**: `if viewModel == nil` ensures init-only-once behavior

#### No Dependencies Added/Removed
- Leveraged existing: QuickForm, SwiftUIRouting, FactoryKit, TestableView
- Enhanced: UI test environment detection patterns

#### Configuration Changes
- **VetNetUITestCase**: Added UI_TEST_MODE launch argument and animation disabling
- **Container+VetNet**: Enhanced with UI test mode detection
- **VetNetApp**: Added background service bypassing for UI tests
- **mise.toml**: Updated for development environment

### üìö Critical Learnings for Future Development

#### SwiftUI Best Practices (2024)
1. **Never initialize @State with external data in init()** - use onAppear with guard
2. **Modal/popover presentation can trigger parent view recreation** - design accordingly
3. **@Observable + @State requires careful lifecycle management** - consider @StateObject for complex models
4. **Always test picker interactions** - they're particularly sensitive to state management issues

#### UI Testing Patterns
1. **Implement UI test mode detection early** - bypass background services and complex initialization
2. **Use systematic elimination methodology** - create minimal reproduction cases
3. **Screen object pattern with method chaining** - improves test readability and maintenance
4. **Async test patterns** - proper MainActor isolation for Swift 6

#### Debugging Complex Integration Issues
1. **Create minimal reproduction environments** - Belfalas demo was crucial
2. **Test individual components in isolation** - eliminates false leads
3. **Profile state changes during interactions** - identify cascade triggers
4. **Document elimination process** - prevents re-investigation of solved issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- **PatientFormView initialization pattern changed**: View model now created in onAppear instead of init
- **UI test launch arguments required**: Tests depend on UI_TEST_MODE for proper isolation

### ‚úÖ What Was Completed
- ‚úÖ Root cause identification and fix for XCUITest timeout
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive UI testing infrastructure
- ‚úÖ SwiftUI architecture pattern improvements
- ‚úÖ Container configuration enhancements
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation of learnings and patterns

### üîÑ What Wasn't Completed
- Additional UI test scenarios (breed picker, owner fields, save button)
- Complete patient creation end-to-end test
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Performance optimization of test execution time

### üí° Tips for Future Developers

#### When Adding UI Tests
1. Start with UI test mode detection in your app architecture
2. Use screen object pattern from the beginning
3. Test picker interactions early - they reveal state management issues
4. Create isolated test cases for debugging complex interactions

#### When Working with SwiftUI View Models
1. Use onAppear lazy initialization for external data dependencies
2. Consider @StateObject for complex ObservableObject models
3. Be aware of view recreation during modal presentations
4. Test your initialization patterns with UI tests

#### When Debugging XCUITest Issues
1. Create minimal reproduction cases in separate projects
2. Use systematic elimination methodology
3. Profile background tasks and state changes during interactions
4. Don't assume the obvious culprit - dig deeper with evidence
