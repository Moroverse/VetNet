# Introduction

This document outlines the complete iOS architecture for the Veterinary Practice Intelligence application, designed to leverage cutting-edge iOS 26 capabilities, Liquid Glass design system, and Swift 6.2+ modern concurrency patterns. The architecture prioritizes intelligent scheduling algorithms, real-time synchronization, and premium user experience while maintaining professional medical software standards.

**Relationship to PRD:**
This architecture directly implements the requirements defined in the PRD, with particular focus on intelligent specialist matching, VTL protocol integration, and iOS 26 performance optimizations.

## Starter Template Analysis
**Project Approach**: Native iOS development from foundation using modern Swift 6.2+ patterns
**Rationale**: No existing veterinary scheduling solutions leverage iOS 26 + Liquid Glass, creating opportunity for competitive differentiation through cutting-edge architecture
