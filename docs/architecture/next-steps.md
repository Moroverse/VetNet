# Next Steps

## UX Expert Handoff
**Next Phase**: The iOS architecture is complete and ready for detailed UI/UX specification that will define specific Liquid Glass component implementations, veterinary workflow user journeys, and accessibility patterns.

**Key Integration Points**:
- Liquid Glass component specifications for scheduling calendar interfaces
- QuickForm integration patterns for VTL triage assessment workflows  
- Accessibility requirements implementation using iOS 26 enhanced features
- Cross-platform consistency guidelines for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS interfaces

**Architecture Dependencies**: This technical architecture provides the foundation for UI design decisions including performance constraints, component capabilities, and iOS 26 feature utilization.

## Development Implementation Readiness
**Architecture Validation**: All major architectural decisions have been made with specific technology choices, performance targets, and implementation patterns defined. The architecture supports:

- **Intelligent Scheduling**: VTL protocols, specialist matching, and optimization algorithms
- **Premium User Experience**: iOS 26 Liquid Glass with research-validated performance improvements
- **Professional Standards**: HIPAA compliance, accessibility, and medical software requirements
- **Scalable Foundation**: SwiftData with CloudKit for multi-device synchronization and future expansion

**Ready for Epic 1 Implementation**: Foundation & iOS Architecture epic can begin immediately with this technical blueprint.
