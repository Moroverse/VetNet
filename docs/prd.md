# Veterinary Practice Intelligence App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Transform veterinary practice scheduling from administrative task to competitive advantage through intelligent case routing
- Establish premium market position in veterinary software through superior iOS user experience and scheduling intelligence
- Capture the 40% unfilled appointment capacity opportunity identified in industry research
- Solve the systemic specialist matching problem affecting medical outcomes and practice efficiency
- Create scalable foundation for future multi-practice network expansion

### Background Context
Industry research reveals that veterinary practices face a critical gap in intelligent appointment scheduling, with 40% unfilled appointment capacity and "no systems effectively matching case complexity to appropriate specialists." Current solutions suffer from "poor UX design" and "limited scheduling intelligence," creating a significant opportunity for a premium iOS solution.

Our brainstorming sessions identified the core problem through the "broken femur to orthopedic surgeon" scenario - practices consistently struggle to route cases to appropriate specialists due to information gaps, manual processes, and lack of decision support. This results in suboptimal medical outcomes, underutilized specialist capacity, and client retention risks.

The solution leverages proven Veterinary Triage List (VTL) protocols combined with intelligent algorithms to solve the specialist matching problem while delivering premium user experience through Liquid Glass design on iOS platforms.
