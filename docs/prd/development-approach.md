# Development Approach

This document outlines the incremental feature development strategy and engineering practices for the Veterinary Practice Intelligence App, emphasizing vertical slice delivery and continuous deployment.

## Incremental Feature Development Strategy

This PRD adopts a **vertical slice development approach** where each story delivers complete, shippable functionality across all architectural layers (UI, business logic, data persistence) rather than building horizontally layer-by-layer.

### Key Principles

#### Feature Flags
- All new functionality gated behind feature flags
- Safe trunk-based development
- Progressive rollout capability
- A/B testing support
- Instant rollback mechanisms
- Environment-specific toggles

#### Trunk-Based Development
- Single main branch as truth
- Short-lived feature branches (< 2 days)
- Daily integration requirement
- Continuous integration/deployment
- Feature toggles over branches
- Minimal merge conflicts

#### Vertical Slices
- Complete feature implementation
- UI components included
- Business logic integrated
- API endpoints functional
- Database changes complete
- Tests across all layers

#### Incremental User Value
- Every story delivers benefit
- Measurable improvements
- User-facing functionality
- No "technical only" stories
- Immediate production value
- Progressive enhancement

#### Continuous Deployment
- Each story independently deployable
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Rollback capabilities
- Health monitoring
- Performance tracking

## Epic Structure Overview

Based on core user workflows, the following epics deliver incremental value while building toward comprehensive scheduling intelligence:

### Epic Progression
1. **Patient Management Foundation**: Complete patient lifecycle (create, view, edit, delete) with cloud sync - establishes core data foundation
2. **Basic Specialist Management**: Specialist profiles and availability tracking - enables manual appointment assignment
3. **Simple Appointment Scheduling**: Basic appointment creation and calendar views - delivers immediate scheduling value
4. **Intelligent Triage Integration**: VTL protocol assessment with specialist recommendations - adds clinical intelligence
5. **Advanced Scheduling Optimization**: Multi-factor optimization and analytics - maximizes practice efficiency

### Epic Dependencies
- Each epic builds on previous foundations
- Clear value delivery at each stage
- No forward dependencies
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Progressive feature enhancement
- Graceful degradation support

## Story Structure Guidelines

### Story Anatomy
Each story must include:
- **User-facing value**: Clear benefit statement
- **Acceptance criteria**: Measurable completion
- **UI components**: SwiftUI views and ViewModels
- **Domain logic**: Pure business rules and operations
- **Repository interface**: Domain-defined persistence contracts
- **Infrastructure implementation**: SwiftData entity mapping
- **Testing requirements**: Domain, repository, and integration coverage
- **Feature flag**: Toggle configuration

### Story Sizing
- Maximum 3 days of work
- Deployable independently
- Single feature focus
- Clear boundaries
- Minimal dependencies
- Testable in isolation

### Definition of Done
A story is complete when:
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code reviewed and approved
- Tests written and passing
- Documentation updated
- Feature flag configured
- Deployed to staging
- Product owner accepted

## Development Workflow

### Daily Practices
1. **Morning sync**: Team alignment
2. **Feature branch creation**: From latest main
3. **Test-driven development**: Tests first
4. **Continuous integration**: Every commit
5. **Code review**: Before merge
6. **Main branch integration**: Daily minimum
7. **Deployment readiness**: Always shippable

### Code Review Standards
- Automated checks must pass
- Two reviewer approval required
- Architecture compliance verified
- Performance impact assessed
- Security review completed
- Documentation updated
- Tests comprehensive

### Testing Strategy
- **Domain Unit Tests**: Pure business logic testing without persistence dependencies
- **Repository Tests**: Mock implementations for domain layer testing  
- **Integration Tests**: Repository-to-SwiftData entity mapping validation
- **UI Tests**: Critical user flows with mocked repository interfaces
- **Performance Tests**: SwiftData query optimization and constraints
- **Security Tests**: Infrastructure layer HIPAA compliance verification
- **Accessibility Tests**: iOS 26 compliance verification
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-layer edge cases and user scenarios

## Feature Flag Implementation

### Flag Types
- **Release toggles**: New feature control
- **Experiment toggles**: A/B testing
- **Ops toggles**: Circuit breakers
- **Permission toggles**: User access
- **Development toggles**: Work in progress

### Flag Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Named with story ID
2. **Development**: Local override
3. **Testing**: Staging activation
4. **Rollout**: Progressive deployment
5. **Stabilization**: Monitor metrics
6. **Cleanup**: Remove when stable

### Mock Data Strategy
- **Development efficiency**: Consistent test data
- **Demo capability**: Stakeholder presentations
- **User training**: Safe environment
- **Testing scenarios**: Edge cases covered
- **Performance testing**: Large datasets
- **Feature exploration**: Risk-free trials

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Quality Gates
- **Domain layer coverage** > 90% (pure business logic)
- **Repository interface coverage** > 85% (mocked implementations)
- **Integration test coverage** > 70% (entity mapping validation)
- No critical vulnerabilities in Infrastructure layer
- Performance benchmarks met for SwiftData operations
- Clean Architecture compliance (dependency direction validation)
- Build time < 5 minutes
- Zero linting errors

### Manual Quality Checks
- User flow validation
- Visual regression testing
- Cross-device testing
- Performance perception
- Error handling verification
- Data integrity confirmation

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
1. **Local**: Developer machines
2. **CI**: Automated testing
3. **Staging**: Pre-production
