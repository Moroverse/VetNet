# Epic 1: Foundation & iOS Architecture

**Epic Goal**: Establish robust iOS application foundation with modern Swift 6.2+ architecture, Liquid Glass design system, and comprehensive testing infrastructure that supports sophisticated scheduling intelligence features.

## Story 1.1: iOS Project Setup & Architecture Foundation
As a veterinary practice staff member,
I want a fast, reliable iOS application foundation,
so that the scheduling system performs optimally during busy practice operations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. iOS project created with Swift 6.2+ supporting iOS 18+, iPadOS 18+, and macOS 15+ deployment targets
2. Factory dependency injection container configured with practice-specific service registration
3. SwiftUIRouting navigation system integrated for veterinary workflow optimization
4. Swift Testing framework configured with Mockable integration for service layer testing
5. SwiftData stack implemented with cloud synchronization capability for practice data
6. Basic app structure follows MVVM pattern with clear separation between views, view models, and services

## Story 1.2: iOS 26 Liquid Glass Design System Implementation
As a veterinary practice staff member,
I want a beautiful, professional interface leveraging cutting-edge iOS 26 design,
so that our scheduling system reflects our modern practice while achieving superior performance.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. iOS 26 Liquid Glass components library created using glassEffect() modifier with veterinary-specific styling and interactive behaviors
2. GlassEffectContainer implementation for navigation, toolbars, and modal interfaces ensuring visual consistency and 40% GPU performance improvement
3. Interactive glass elements using interactive modifier for scheduling controls with scaling, bouncing, and shimmering feedback
4. Cross-platform design consistency across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 leveraging Apple's unified design language
5. Enhanced accessibility integration with iOS 26 Accessibility Reader, improved VoiceOver compatibility, and Dynamic Type support
6. Performance validation achieving research-confirmed 39% faster rendering and 38% memory reduction for complex scheduling interfaces

## Story 1.3: Advanced iOS 26 Services & State Management
As a veterinary practice staff member,
I want reliable, high-performance data management utilizing iOS 26 capabilities,
so that scheduling information is always accurate, fast, and available across all my devices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. StateKit integration configured for complex scheduling view states with iOS 26 @Observable patterns and glass element state management
2. SwiftData custom DataStore protocol implementation for veterinary-specific data with compound uniqueness constraints using #Unique macro
3. Enhanced query performance with #Index macro for specialist availability searches and appointment conflict detection
4. iOS 26 background app refresh with Metal Performance Shaders integration for real-time schedule updates and notifications
5. iOS Keychain integration with enhanced iOS 26 privacy features for secure authentication token and sensitive veterinary data storage
6. Offline capability framework leveraging SwiftData improvements with automatic conflict resolution for appointment scheduling during network interruptions
