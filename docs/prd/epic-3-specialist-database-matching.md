# Epic 3: Specialist Database & Matching

**Epic Goal**: Create comprehensive specialist expertise management system with intelligent matching algorithms that connect case complexity to appropriate veterinary specialists while considering availability and practice optimization factors.

## Story 3.1: Specialist Profile & Expertise Management
As a veterinary practice manager,
I want detailed specialist profiles with expertise areas,
so that the system can accurately match cases to the most appropriate veterinary professionals.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Specialist profile creation interface captures expertise areas, certifications, experience levels, and special interests
2. Specialty categories defined (orthopedic surgery, soft tissue surgery, internal medicine, dermatology, cardiology, oncology, neurology, ophthalmology, etc.)
3. Expertise level scoring system (novice, competent, expert) for different procedure and case types
4. Historical case success tracking links specialists to outcomes for continuous matching improvement
5. Availability preferences and scheduling constraints captured per specialist (preferred case types, time blocks, etc.)
6. Profile management allows updates to expertise, availability, and preferences with proper audit trails

## Story 3.2: Real-time Availability Management
As a veterinary practice staff member,
I want current specialist availability information,
so that I can make scheduling decisions based on actual capacity rather than outdated information.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Real-time calendar integration shows current specialist availability with buffer time considerations
2. Availability status includes scheduled appointments, surgery blocks, administrative time, and personal time off
3. Capacity indicators show appointment slots available with estimated duration requirements
4. Emergency slot management reserves capacity for urgent cases while optimizing routine scheduling
5. Cross-device synchronization ensures availability updates appear immediately across all practice devices
6. Availability prediction algorithm suggests optimal scheduling windows based on historical patterns and current load

## Story 3.3: Intelligent Specialist Matching Algorithm
As a veterinary practice staff member,
I want automated specialist recommendations for cases,
so that I can quickly identify the best care provider while considering all relevant factors.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Multi-factor matching algorithm weighs case complexity, specialist expertise, availability, and urgency level
2. Matching score display shows reasoning behind recommendations with transparency for learning
3. Alternative specialist suggestions provided with pros/cons analysis (expertise vs. availability tradeoffs)
4. Client retention risk assessment flags cases where delays might drive clients to competing practices
5. Practice optimization balance between ideal specialist matching and schedule efficiency
6. Learning system improves matching accuracy based on case outcomes and specialist feedback
