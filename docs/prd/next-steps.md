# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
**Next Phase**: Create comprehensive UI/UX specification document that transforms these requirements into detailed interface designs, user flows, and interaction patterns optimized for veterinary practice workflows and Liquid Glass design system implementation.

Focus areas: Smart triage form design, specialist matching interface patterns, calendar optimization visualization, and iPad-first interaction paradigms.

## Architect Prompt  
**Next Phase**: Design comprehensive iOS architecture that supports intelligent scheduling algorithms, real-time data synchronization, and scalable service architecture. 

Key considerations: Swift 6.2+ concurrency patterns, Factory DI architecture, QuickForm integration patterns, StateKit usage for complex scheduling states, and SwiftUIRouting navigation for veterinary workflows. Include detailed technical specifications for specialist matching algorithms and schedule optimization engine.
