# Functional Requirements

This document outlines all functional requirements for the Veterinary Practice Intelligence App, organized by core capability areas.

## Smart Triage & Case Assessment

### FR1: VTL Protocol Implementation
The application implements standardized Veterinary Triage List (VTL) protocols with 5-level urgency assessment:
- **Red**: Life-threatening emergency requiring immediate attention
- **Orange**: Urgent condition requiring prompt treatment
- **Yellow**: Moderate urgency with scheduled priority
- **Green**: Non-urgent routine care
- **Blue**: Elective procedures and wellness visits

### FR2: Guided Intake Questionnaire
Guided intake questionnaire system helps staff identify case complexity and specialist requirements through:
- Structured questions adapting based on previous answers
- Species-specific assessment pathways
- Symptom severity evaluation
- Medical history integration
- Duration and progression tracking
