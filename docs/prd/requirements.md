# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**Smart Triage & Case Assessment**
- FR1: The application implements standardized Veterinary Triage List (VTL) protocols with 5-level urgency assessment (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green/Blue)
- FR2: Guided intake questionnaire system helps staff identify case complexity and specialist requirements through structured questions
- FR3: ABCDE assessment protocol integration (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Environment) for systematic evaluation
- FR4: Case complexity scoring algorithm analyzes symptoms, urgency, and specialist requirements for optimal routing decisions

**Intelligent Specialist Matching**
- FR5: Multi-factor matching algorithm weighs specialist expertise, availability, case urgency, and client retention factors
- FR6: Real-time specialist availability display shows current schedules with expertise areas and appointment capacity
- FR7: Time vs. quality tradeoff recommendations help staff balance optimal specialist matching against scheduling constraints
- FR8: Historical outcome tracking improves matching accuracy over time based on successful case-specialist pairings

**Dynamic Schedule Optimization**
- FR9: Real-time calendar interface displays specialist availability with intelligent appointment duration predictions
- FR10: Schedule optimization algorithms maximize both specialist utilization and appropriate case-specialist matching
- FR11: Client retention risk assessment flags cases where scheduling delays could drive clients to competitors
- FR12: Appointment conflict resolution system handles emergency cases and schedule adjustments

**Premium iOS User Experience**
- FR13: Native SwiftUI interface implements Liquid Glass design system using glassEffect() modifier, GlassEffectContainer, and interactive modifier for veterinary-specific workflows
- FR14: iPad-optimized workflows with floating glass elements, adaptive sidebars that refract content, and enhanced sheet presentations optimized for practice staff usage patterns
- FR15: Seamless cross-platform experience across iOS 26+, iPadOS 26+, and macOS 26+ with unified design language and automatic visual improvements
- FR16: Enhanced navigation using custom SwiftUIRouting with Liquid Glass morphing effects and glassEffectID for fluid transitions between scheduling views
