### Repository Pattern Architecture with Centralized Infrastructure

#### Clean Architecture Implementation
**Three-Layer Data Architecture with Centralized Infrastructure**:
1. **Domain Models**: Pure Swift objects in feature modules (`Features/*/Domain/Models/`)
   - No persistence or framework dependencies
   - Rich business logic and domain operations (age calculation, validation)
   - Species-specific breed validation rules and medical ID generation algorithms
   - Testable in complete isolation

2. **Repository Protocols**: Domain-defined interfaces (`Features/*/Domain/Repositories/`)
   - Abstract persistence operations with domain-centric method signatures
   - Enable mockable testing with `MockPatientRepository` implementations
   - Support async/await patterns for all operations

3. **Centralized Infrastructure Layer**: Shared across ALL feature modules (`Infrastructure/`)
   - **SwiftData Entities**: `Infrastructure/Persistence/Entities/` with `@Model` entities
   - **Repository Implementations**: `Infrastructure/Repositories/` mapping between domain and entities
   - **CloudKit Integration**: Automatic synchronization and conflict resolution
   - **Compound Constraints**: Business rule enforcement via `@Attribute(.unique)`
   - **Custom DataStore Protocol**: HIPAA compliance at Infrastructure boundary

#### Repository Implementation Pattern
```swift
// Domain Layer (Features/Scheduling/Domain/Repositories/)
protocol AppointmentRepository {
    func save(_ appointment: Appointment) async throws
    func findById(_ id: AppointmentId) async throws -> Appointment?
    func findConflicts(for appointment: Appointment) async throws -> [Appointment]
}

// Infrastructure Layer (Infrastructure/Repositories/)
final class SwiftDataAppointmentRepository: AppointmentRepository {
    // Maps between domain models and SwiftData entities
    // Handles all persistence concerns
    // Provides clean abstraction
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Testability**: Domain logic tested without persistence dependencies
- **Clean Architecture**: Business rules isolated from technical concerns  
- **SwiftData Power**: Advanced constraints, relationships, CloudKit sync
- **Maintainability**: Changes to persistence don't affect business logic

### Backend Integration

- URLSession with modern APIs
- Codable for serialization
- Request/response interceptors

#### Data Persistence
**SwiftData with Repository Pattern Architecture**:
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Pure domain models in feature modules' Domain layers
- **Infrastructure Layer**: SwiftData `@Model` entities in shared `Infrastructure/Persistence/Entities/`
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean abstraction between domain logic and persistence concerns
- **Custom DataStore protocol**: HIPAA compliance at Infrastructure boundary
- **Real-time synchronization**: CloudKit integration through Infrastructure layer
- **Compound uniqueness**: Business rule enforcement via `@Attribute(.unique)`
- **Query performance**: Optimized through repository implementations
- **Migration support**: Handled at Infrastructure layer
- **Conflict resolution**: Repository-managed with domain model mapping
