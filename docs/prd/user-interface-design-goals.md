# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create the first veterinary scheduling application that feels as premium and intuitive as consumer iOS apps while solving complex professional workflow challenges. The interface should make intelligent scheduling decisions feel natural and effortless, transforming a stressful administrative task into a confident, data-driven process.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
**Guided Decision Making**: Rather than overwhelming users with options, the app guides staff through intelligent triage and scheduling decisions using progressive disclosure and smart defaults based on case analysis.

**Visual Schedule Intelligence**: Calendar interfaces show not just availability but specialist expertise, case complexity matches, and optimization suggestions through color coding, badges, and contextual information.

**Contextual Information Architecture**: Relevant patient history, specialist expertise, and practice patterns surface automatically based on current case and scheduling context.

## Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, these critical screens deliver PRD value:

**Smart Intake Screen**: Guided triage questionnaire implementing VTL protocols with dynamic question branching based on case complexity

**Intelligent Scheduling Dashboard**: Real-time specialist availability with matching scores, optimization suggestions, and schedule conflict resolution

**Case Routing Interface**: Visual specialist matching with expertise indicators, availability windows, and time-vs-quality tradeoff recommendations

**Schedule Optimization View**: Calendar interface showing optimized appointments with utilization metrics and efficiency insights

**Practice Analytics Dashboard**: Scheduling performance insights, specialist utilization rates, and client retention metrics

## Accessibility
**Target Standard**: WCAG AA compliance with full iOS accessibility integration

## Branding
**Design System**: Liquid Glass aesthetic adapted for veterinary practice environment - Apple's new translucent material design that reflects and refracts surroundings while dynamically transforming to bring focus to content. Research confirms 40% GPU usage reduction, 39% faster render times, and 38% memory reduction, making it ideal for complex scheduling interfaces while conveying medical competence and technological sophistication

## Target Device and Platforms
**Primary**: iPadOS 26+ optimized for iPad Pro workflows in veterinary practice settings
**Secondary**: iOS 26+ for mobile companion features and macOS 26+ for practice management overview

**Cross-Platform Consistency**: Leveraging Apple's first unified design language across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26 for seamless user experience as veterinary staff move between devices
