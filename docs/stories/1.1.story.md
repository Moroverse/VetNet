## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the foundation story for the project.

### Data Models
Core SwiftData models required for foundation: [Source: architecture/data-models.md#core-business-entities]
- **Practice Entity**: Primary practice organization model with UUID identifier, CloudKit sync
- **Specialist Entity**: Veterinary professional model with expertise areas and availability
- **Patient Entity**: Animal patient model with medical history and case complexity
- **Appointment Entity**: Scheduled appointment model with specialist matching and triage data

Key SwiftData patterns to implement: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#language-specific-guidelines]
- Use @Model macro with proper relationships and CloudKit-compatible types
- Implement compound uniqueness constraints using @Attribute(.unique)
- Configure proper delete rules for data integrity

### API Specifications
Foundation services to configure: [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#key-services-utilized]
- **CloudKit**: Primary cloud synchronization with HIPAA-compliant data handling
- **Apple Sign-In**: Practice-level authentication with role-based access control
- **Core ML + Metal Performance Shaders**: AI-powered scheduling optimization foundation

### Component Specifications
UI Foundation Components: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **SwiftUI + iOS 26**: User interface framework with Liquid Glass design system
- **StateKit + @Observable**: Complex view states for scheduling interfaces
- **iOS 26 Accessibility APIs**: Professional compliance with Accessibility Reader

```

### Testing Requirements
Testing Framework Integration: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#swift-testing-framework-integration]
- Use Swift Testing framework with @Suite and @Test attributes
- Implement @Mockable protocols for service layer testing
- Use ViewInspector for SwiftUI component testing with accessibility identifiers
- Tests with ViewInspector will require XCTest framework
- Configure test targets matching project modular structure

Required test patterns:
- Use #expect() assertions instead of XCTAssert when using Swift Testing
- Implement accessibility identifier testing for reliable UI component finding
- Test structured concurrency patterns with async/await

### Technical Constraints
iOS 26 + Swift 6.2+ Requirements: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Language**: Swift 6.2+ with structured concurrency patterns
- **iOS Version**: iOS 26 target for main application, iOS 17.0+ for SwiftUIRouting module
- **Architecture**: MVVM + @Observable for optimal SwiftUI integration
- **Deployment**: iOS 26+, iPadOS 26+, macOS 15+ support

Critical Architecture Rules: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#ios-26-swift-62-development-standards]
- All data models must use @Model macro with proper relationships
- Use TaskGroup for parallel operations, async/await for all service calls
- All UI components must integrate iOS 26 accessibility features
- Use GlassEffectContainer for multiple glass elements

### Testing

#### Testing Standards for Foundation Story
Test File Locations: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#ios-26-testing-architecture]
- Unit tests in corresponding test targets within modular packages
- Integration tests in main application test target
- Service layer tests using Mockable for dependency injection testing

Testing Frameworks and Patterns: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#swift-testing-framework-integration]
- **Swift Testing**: Use @Suite and @Test attributes with #expect() assertions
- **Mockable**: Service protocol mocking for testable architecture
- **ViewInspector**: SwiftUI component testing with accessibility identifiers
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify VoiceOver compatibility and Dynamic Type support

Specific Requirements for Foundation:
- Test dependency injection container service registration
- Verify SwiftData model relationships and CloudKit compatibility
- Test SwiftUIRouting navigation patterns and type safety
- Validate MVVM architecture separation and @Observable integration
